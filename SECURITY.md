## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please use GitHub's built-in **private vulnerability reporting** feature:

1. Go to the [AlignTrue repository](https://github.com/AlignTrue/aligntrue)
2. Click **Security** in the repository navigation
3. Select **Report a vulnerability**
4. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

**Response timeline:**

- We'll acknowledge your report within 3 business days
- We'll provide regular updates on our investigation
- We'll notify you when the vulnerability is fixed or declined

**What to expect:**

- If accepted, we'll work to fix the vulnerability and may credit you in our security advisories
- If declined, we'll explain why and suggest alternative approaches if applicable
- All reports are handled confidentially until a fix is available

For non-security related issues or questions, please use regular GitHub issues.
