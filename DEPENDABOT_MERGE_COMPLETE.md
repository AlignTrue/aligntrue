### Test Results

| Package | Tests | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| @aligntrue/schema | 67 | ✅ Pass |
| @aligntrue/cli | 100 | ✅ Pass |

| TypeScript build | All | ✅ Pass |

**Critical tests verified:**

## Phase 3: Vitest Major Upgrades ✅ MERGED

All three vitest 1.6.1 → 4.0.4 major version bumps merged:

| PR | Package | Version | Status | Commit |
|---|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| #2 | root | 1.6.1 → 4.0.4 | ✅ Merged | `d06a0dc` |
| #3 | packages/cli | 1.6.1 → 4.0.4 | ✅ Merged | `908500e` |
| #4 | packages/schema | 1.6.1 → 4.0.4 | ✅ Merged | `9404f6e` |

**Result:** Full test suite passes with vitest 4.0.4

---

## Phase 3b: Redundant PR ✅ CONSOLIDATED

| PR | Package | Type | Version | Status | Note |
|---|---------|------|---------|--------|------|
| #6 | root+cli | @clack/prompts | 0.7.0 → 0.11.0 | ✅ Merged | Applied after #1 |

**Merged commit:** `4f377bd` (with conflict resolution)

**Note:** This PR applied the same @clack/prompts update across more packages. Merged after root vitest to avoid lockfile conflicts. Conflict in pnpm-lock.yaml resolved by keeping main's version (already correct).

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All 6 PRs identified and categorized
- [x] Low-risk PRs merged immediately
- [x] All vitest PRs tested locally (multiple packages)
- [x] TypeScript build verified after each merge

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This week)

1. **Monitor CI/CD** – GitHub Actions should validate all merges on both Linux and Windows
2. **Verify no regressions** – Run `pnpm test` locally one final time
3. **Close duplicate PRs** – Dependabot may auto-detect duplicates

### Optional (Future)

- Pin vitest at 4.0.4 in `.npmrc` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` if you want to stay on this version
- Consider deprecating older vitest versions in documentation
