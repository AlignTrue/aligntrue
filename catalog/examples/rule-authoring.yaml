  # Rule Authoring Guideline

  ## Core Principles

  - Write for the Agent (imperative, actionable)
  - One topic per rule
  - Declare scope and exclusions explicitly
  - Lead with hard constraints
  - Encode precedence if conflict possible

  ## Rule Structure

  Header:
  - id, version, profile, spec_version
  - summary, tags, deps
  - scope (applies_to, includes, excludes)

  Body:
  - rules: machine-checkable rules with severity
  - integrity: canonical hash
  - notes: clarifications for maintainers
  - guidance: extended documentation

  ## Precedence Encoding

  Use explicit verbs:
  - "overrides @target" - takes precedence over target
  - "defers to @target" - target takes precedence
  - "complements @target" - work together

  ## Output Contract

  When proposing rule changes:
  1. Summary of change
  2. Rationale
  3. Updated rule text only
  4. Impacted areas and precedence notes
  5. Tests or examples if relevant
  6. Conflict check

  ## Best Practices

  - Keep rules â‰¤500 lines
  - Add minimal examples
  - Prefer paved-road patterns over prohibitions
  - Reference other rules with @ notation
  - Keep diffs minimal
  - Remove obsolete parts
