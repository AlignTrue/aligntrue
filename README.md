AlignTrue — Alignment-as-Code

AlignTrue defines a new layer in software: Alignment-as-Code — the open, deterministic rules system that keeps humans and AI agents aligned to the same truth. It turns organizational intent into small, machine-checkable rule packs (“Aligns”) that can be verified, versioned, and exported into any agent or workflow. Enforcement stays local, governance stays transparent, and drift is measurable.

AlignTrue is vendor-neutral, cryptographically signed, and designed to make alignment portable — from solo devs to global teams.

Your code has Git. Your behavior has AlignTrue.
