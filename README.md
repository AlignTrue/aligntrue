# Introduction

> ⚠️ **Alpha:** AlignTrue AI ops platform is in active development. Expect substantial changes while we dogfood the architecture.

AlignTrue is an AI ops platform focused on supervised AI execution with receipts and auditability. It emphasizes deterministic behavior, envelopes-first design, and rebuildable projections so teams can trust AI outputs.

## What it does

- Separates commands (intent) from events (what happened), with explicit time and causality.
- Stores receipts and artifacts so executions are explainable and replayable.
- Keeps behavior out of the core event log; policies and packs are versioned and testable.

## Current status

- Alpha-quality; APIs and contracts may change.
- Local-first: core flows run without cloud dependencies.
- Dogfooding across tasks/notes; broader capabilities will evolve.
