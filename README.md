# Introduction

> ⚠️ **Beta:** AlignTrue AI ops platform is in active development. Expect substantial changes while we dogfood the architecture.

_Note: The AlignTrue Sync tool for managing AI rules was split out to its own repo [here](https://github.com/AlignTrue/aligntrue-sync)_

AlignTrue is the system of record for AI. Models commoditize, trust doesn't. We lead with receipts and auditability, emphasizing deterministic behavior, envelopes-first design, and rebuildable projections so teams can trust AI outputs.

## What it does

- **AI without receipts is a liability.** If you can’t prove what it saw, why it decided, and what it did, you can’t trust it in production.
- **Behavior drift is a death spiral.** Agents copy inconsistency at machine speed; a system of record keeps behavior governable.
- **If you can’t replay it, you can’t run it.** Real operations need auditability, rollback, and deterministic recovery.

## Current status

- Beta-quality; APIs and contracts may change.
- Local-first: core flows run without cloud dependencies.
- Dogfooding across tasks/notes; broader capabilities will evolve.
