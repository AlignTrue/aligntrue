### Phase 4.5, Session 2: Exporter Base Class Refactoring (Completed 2025-10-31)

**Consolidated 32 exporters to extend `ExporterBase` class:**

- **Created `ExporterBase` abstract class** (`packages/exporters/src/base/exporter-base.ts`)
  - `computeHash(irContent)` - Canonical hashing with vendor.\*.volatile exclusion
  - `computeFidelityNotes(rules)` - Generic fidelity note generation
  - `writeFile(path, content, dryRun)` - Atomic file writing with dry-run support
  - `validateManifest()` - Manifest validation
  - `buildResult(files, hash, notes)` - Standard ExportResult construction
  - 18 comprehensive tests ensuring base functionality

- **Refactored 32 exporters** to extend `ExporterBase`
  - Replaced `implements ExporterPlugin` with `extends ExporterBase`
  - Removed duplicate `AtomicFileWriter` instantiation patterns
  - Replaced manual `ExportResult` building with `this.buildResult()`
  - Changed `private computeFidelityNotes()` to `protected` for custom overrides
  - Preserved exporter-specific fidelity messages (cursor, agents-md, vscode-mcp, etc.)

**Exporters refactored:**

- cursor, agents-md, vscode-mcp, cline, goose
- aider-config, claude-md, cursor-mcp, amazonq, amazonq-mcp

  - Implemented `aln update --safe` with heuristic-based conflict detection
  - Detects potential overlay conflicts by matching selectors against affected rule IDs
  - Auto-resolve strategies: `--auto-resolve ours` (keep overlays) or `theirs` (use upstream)
  - Generates conflict reports in `.aligntrue/artifacts/`
  - Non-blocking: warns about conflicts without preventing updates
  - Graceful degradation: doesn't block on errors

- **Phase 3.5 completion summary**
  - All overlay functionality implemented and tested (163 tests)
  - CLI commands complete: `aln override add/status/diff/remove`
  - Safe update mode operational with conflict detection
  - Three-way merge algorithm available for future optimization
  - Documentation complete and accurate

### Phase 4, Session 1: Catalog Foundation - Abuse Limits Updated (Completed 2025-10-31)

**Abuse control limits updated to realistic values:**

- **Pack YAML limit reduced:** 10MB → **1MB** (still allows ~5,000 rules, 10x more realistic)
- **Exporter preview limit reduced:** 5MB → **512KB** (still allows ~2,500 rules, 10x more realistic)
- **Total catalog budget unchanged:** 500MB (now supports 200-500 packs with reduced limits)
- **Early warning system added:** Alerts at 50% catalog usage (250MB) to address capacity early

**New features:**

**Rationale:**

- Current example packs: ~2-3KB YAML, ~3KB previews
- Even 500-rule pack: ~200KB YAML, ~250KB preview
- Original limits were 500x realistic size (wasteful, harder to review)
- New limits still very generous while being cost-effective

**Next:** Phase 3.5 continues with remaining sessions (finalization, polish, edge cases)

---

### Phase 3.5, Session 6: Triple-Hash Lockfile & Drift Detection (Completed 2025-10-31)

**Triple-hash lockfile format (overlay-aware):**

- Lockfile entries now store `base_hash`, `overlay_hash`, and `result_hash` when overlays are applied
- `base_hash`: Hash of upstream pack (before overlays)
- `overlay_hash`: Hash of overlay configuration (deterministic, sorted by selector)
- `result_hash`: Hash of final IR after overlay application
- `content_hash` remains as alias to `result_hash` for backward compatibility
- Single-hash lockfiles (no overlays) continue to work without changes

**Enhanced drift detection:**

- New drift categories: `upstream`, `overlay`, and `result`
- **Upstream drift**: `base_hash` differs → upstream pack updated
- **Overlay drift**: `overlay_hash` differs → local overlay config changed
- **Result drift**: `result_hash` differs despite matching base/overlay → non-deterministic behavior
- Existing categories preserved: `severity_remap`, `vendorized`, `local_overlay` (legacy)
- Triple-hash details included in drift findings for actionable resolution

**Update command enhancement:**

- Uses `base_hash` for update detection when available (more precise for overlays)
- Falls back to `content_hash` for backward compatibility
- Suggests `aligntrue update apply` for base_hash drift
- Documents that overlays are automatically re-applied to new upstream versions

**Lockfile generator improvements:**

- `generateLockfile()` accepts optional `overlays` and `basePack` parameters
- `computeOverlayHash()` exported for deterministic overlay hashing
- Triple-hash fields only added when overlays present
- Maintains determinism across pack loading and application

**Tests:**

- 55 new tests for triple-hash functionality (29 lockfile + 26 drift detection)
- All 1650 tests passing (1595 previous + 55 new)
- Coverage: triple-hash generation, overlay hashing, drift categorization, update detection
- Backward compatibility verified for single-hash lockfiles

**Files modified:**

- packages/core/src/lockfile/types.ts: Added triple-hash fields to LockfileEntry
- packages/core/src/lockfile/generator.ts: Implemented triple-hash generation
- packages/core/src/team/drift.ts: Enhanced drift detection with new categories
- packages/core/src/team/updates.ts: Added base_hash support for update detection
- packages/cli/src/commands/update.ts: Documented overlay re-application behavior

**Technical notes:**

- Overlay hash computed from canonicalized JSON with stable sort by selector
- Triple-hash format enables precise drift categorization
- Backward compatible: old lockfiles without triple-hash continue to work
- Update detection prioritizes base_hash when available for overlay-aware behavior

**Next:** Phase 3.5 continues with remaining session work (Session 7+)

### Phase 3.5, Checkpoint 1: Stage 1 Complete (Foundation + CLI Scaffold) (Completed 2025-10-30)

**Summary:**

Stage 1 complete with full overlay foundation (config schema, selector engine, operations, application logic, sync integration) and minimal CLI scaffold. All 1746 tests passing (108 overlay-specific). Ready for Session 3: full CLI implementation with add/status/diff commands.

**What's working:**

- ✅ Config schema with validation (set/remove/limits)
- ✅ Selector parser (rule[id=...], array[0], property.path)
- ✅ Selector engine (exact matching, ambiguity detection)
- ✅ Set/remove operations with dot-notation paths
- ✅ Application algorithm (ordering, conflict detection, size limits)
- ✅ Sync engine integration (IR → overlays → export)
- ✅ Minimal CLI override command (help + status subcommand)

**Deferred to Session 3:**

- `aln override add` (interactive overlay creation)
- `aln override diff` (show before/after changes)
- Full integration tests for override workflow
- Golden repo examples

**Test results:**

- Total: 1746/1746 passing (22 file-utils, 113 schema, 109 markdown-parser, 792 core, 81 sources, 221 exporters, 57 checks, 12 testkit, 339 cli)
- Overlay-specific: 108/108 passing (31 selector-parser, 27 selector-engine, 13 config-schema, 22 operations, 15 apply)
- CLI override: 5/5 smoke tests passing (help, unknown subcommand handling)

**Files created (Session 1+2):**

- packages/core/src/overlays/types.ts
- packages/core/src/overlays/selector-parser.ts
- packages/core/src/overlays/selector-engine.ts
- packages/core/src/overlays/operations.ts
- packages/core/src/overlays/apply.ts
- packages/core/src/overlays/index.ts
- packages/core/tests/overlays/\*.test.ts (5 files)
- packages/cli/src/commands/override.ts (minimal v1)
- packages/cli/tests/commands/override.test.ts (5 smoke tests)

**Config changes:**

- packages/core/src/config/index.ts: Added overlays field
- packages/core/schema/config.schema.json: Added overlays schema
- packages/core/src/sync/engine.ts: Integrated overlay application

**Next:** Session 3 - Implement full CLI override commands (add, status, diff) with interactive mode and validation

---

### Phase 3.5, Session 2: Overlay Application Logic (Completed 2025-10-30)

**Overlay application (Phase 3.5 pre-launch):**

- Overlay operations module: set/remove property operations with dot-notation paths
- Deep clone for safe IR modification (no mutations of original)
- Array merging as sets with stable sort for determinism
- Application algorithm: deterministic ordering (file order + stable sort by selector)
- Conflict detection: warns when multiple overlays target same properties (last wins)
- Size limit enforcement: max overlays (default 50), max operations per override (default 20)
- Line ending normalization (LF with single trailing LF) before hashing
- Sync engine integration: overlays applied after plugs resolution, before export

**Tests:**

- 108 overlay tests passing (71 Session 1 + 37 Session 2)
- All 792 core package tests passing (no regressions)
- Test coverage: set/remove operations, application logic, size limits, conflict warnings

**Files created:**

- packages/core/src/overlays/operations.ts (~180 lines)
- packages/core/src/overlays/apply.ts (~330 lines)
- packages/core/tests/overlays/operations.test.ts (22 tests)
- packages/core/tests/overlays/apply.test.ts (15 tests)

**Sync engine integration:**

- Overlays applied in syncToAgents after IR loading and plugs resolution
- Audit trail entry for overlay application
- Failure handling with clear error messages
- Optional limits passed from config

**Technical notes:**

- Operations applied in deterministic order: set before remove
- Property paths support nested access with dot notation
- Empty segments in paths are skipped safely
- Triple-hash computation deferred to Session 6 (lockfile integration)

**Next:** Session 3 - CLI override commands (add, status, diff)

### Phase 3.5, Session 1: Overlay Schema & Selector Engine (Completed 2025-10-30)

**Overlay foundation (Phase 3.5 pre-launch):**

- Overlay config schema with `overrides` field and `limits` for size enforcement
- JSON Schema validation for overlays: selector format, set/remove operations, additionalProperties=false
- Deterministic selector language: `rule[id=...]`, property paths, array indices (no wildcards/regex/functions)
- Selector parser with validation: detects wildcards, regex patterns, computed functions
- Selector evaluation engine: exact-match requirement, stale/ambiguous selector detection
- Overlay types module: OverlayDefinition, SelectorMatch, ValidationResult, triple-hash format
- Config integration: overlays added to knownFields, OverlayConfig imported from overlays module

**Tests:**

- 71 overlay tests passing (31 selector parser, 27 selector engine, 13 config schema)
- All 755 core package tests passing (no regressions)
- Test coverage: valid/invalid selectors, schema validation, stale/ambiguous detection

**Files created:**

- packages/core/src/overlays/types.ts (~150 lines)
- packages/core/src/overlays/selector-parser.ts (~220 lines)
- packages/core/src/overlays/selector-engine.ts (~250 lines)
- packages/core/src/overlays/index.ts (exports)
- packages/core/tests/overlays/ (3 test files, 71 tests)

**Technical notes:**

- Selectors match exactly one target or fail (determinism)
- Property paths limited to 10 levels, array indices 0-1000
- Stable sort order: rule < property < array_index, then lexicographic
- Default limits: 50 overrides, 20 operations per override

**Next:** Session 2 - Overlay application logic with triple-hash computation

### Phase 3, Session 10: Test Standardization & Polish (Completed 2025-10-30)

**Test framework standardization:**

- Created comprehensive TESTING.md guide (~450 lines) with unit vs integration patterns
- Standardized 4 command tests (adapters, privacy, scopes, telemetry) to use mockCommandArgs() helper
- Documented test patterns: mock-heavy unit tests, integration tests, helper utilities, anti-patterns
- Test audit identified helper adoption opportunities across 20 CLI test files

**Team examples:**

- team-repo example (10 files ~1400 lines): config, allow list, team.yaml, lockfile, rationale, vendored pack
- vendored-pack example (7 files ~1200 lines): submodule/subtree workflows, README with detailed instructions
- Both examples demonstrate real-world team collaboration patterns

**Performance optimization:**

- CacheManager implementation (~320 lines) with TTL, size limits, LRU eviction
- 27 cache tests passing: get/set, expiration, size limits, LRU eviction, statistics
- Cache utilities: gitCacheKey, catalogCacheKey, validationCacheKey, estimateSize
- Incremental validation foundation: ValidationState tracking, shouldUseIncremental (git integration deferred)
- Parallel operations foundation: processInParallel with error aggregation, concurrency limits

**Documentation polish:**

- Added troubleshooting section to team-mode.md (~60 lines)
- Cross-links added: team-mode ↔ drift-detection ↔ auto-updates ↔ git-workflows ↔ onboarding
- Updated quickstart.md with team setup section (~15 lines, 4-step workflow)
- "See also" sections added to major docs for discoverability

**Test coverage:**

- CLI: 334/334 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Core: 684/684 tests passing (includes 27 cache tests, 100% pass rate)
- Total: ~1018 tests passing

**Known limitations:**

- Performance foundations need opt-in integration into git/catalog/validation paths
- Test helper adoption demonstrated but not exhaustive (pattern established)
- Full incremental validation deferred until performance data shows need

---

### Phase 3, Session 8: Auto-Update Flow + CLI Drift Test Fixes (Completed 2025-10-30)

**CLI drift tests fixed:**

- Activated all 22 skipped drift CLI tests (100% pass rate)
- Fixed config setup issues (removed invalid fields like `allow`)
- Fixed flag parsing (gates/json/sarif flags needed -- prefix)
- Fixed output formatting to show hashes and vendor info in tests
- TypeScript strict optional property handling

**Auto-update detection:**

- Core logic in `@aligntrue/core/team/updates.ts` (~180 lines)
- Functions: detectUpstreamUpdates, generateUpdateSummary, detectUpdatesForConfig
- Compares lockfile entries to allow list resolved hashes
- Git-only updates (catalog support deferred to Phase 4)

**UPDATE_NOTES.md generation:**

- Human-readable format with summary, version changes, affected rules
- Breaking change indicators
- Next steps section with actionable commands
- CLI: `aligntrue update check` (preview), `aligntrue update apply` (apply + sync)
- Auto-sync after updates for seamless workflow

**Documentation:**

- Created auto-updates.md (~340 lines): manual workflows, CI examples, best practices, troubleshooting
- Updated team-mode.md with severity remapping section (~165 lines)
- Updated commands.md with update command documentation (~50 lines)
- CI examples: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

**Test coverage:**

- CLI: 219→241 tests (+22 drift tests activated)
- Core: +15 updates tests
- Total: +37 tests (100% pass rate)

**Known limitations:**

- Catalog source updates deferred to Phase 4 (TODO added in updates.ts)
- Update command tests not implemented (basic functionality works, comprehensive tests deferred)

---

### Phase 3, Session 7: Severity Remapping (Core Complete) (Completed 2025-10-30)

**Severity remapping schema:**

- User-facing: MUST/SHOULD/MAY (align spec)
- Internal: error/warn/info (IR severity)
- `.aligntrue.team.yaml` with severity_remaps array
- Fields: rule_id, from (MUST/SHOULD/MAY), to (error/warn/info), rationale_file (optional)

**Guardrails:**

- Lowering MUST to info requires rationale_file with documented justification
- Rationale file must exist and contain issue tracking link
- `aln drift` emits "policy regression" finding if rationale missing

**Integration:**

- Checks engine applies remaps in team mode only
- Metadata preservation: originalSeverity tracked in check results for audit trail
- Lockfile integration: team_yaml_hash field captures severity remap state
- Drift detection: compares team.yaml hash in lockfile to detect remap changes

**Test coverage:**

- Core: +27 remap tests (parsing, validation, application, guardrails)
- Core: +8 drift tests (severity_remap category)
- Checks: +5 tests (remap application in engine)
- Total: +40 tests (100% pass rate)

**Known limitations:**

- CLI drift tests need config setup fixes (22 tests skipped, fixed in Session 8)
- Documentation needs team-mode.md update (deferred to Session 8)

---

### Phase 3, Session 6: Drift Detection System (Foundation Complete) (Completed 2025-10-30)

**Drift detection core logic:**

- `@aligntrue/core/team/drift.ts` (~350 lines)

**High-level API:**

- `detectDriftForConfig()` wrapper for CLI integration
- Handles path resolution, config loading, lockfile validation internally
- Returns categorized drift results with actionable suggestions

**CLI command structure:**

- `aln drift` command created (~200 lines)
- Argument parsing: --gates, --json, --sarif flags
- Output formatting: human-readable, JSON, SARIF

- Severity remap drift needs Session 7 `.aligntrue.team.yaml` implementation (completed Session 7)

---

### Phase 3, Session 5: Link Command Complete (Completed 2025-10-29)

**Link command core:**

- `aligntrue link` command operational for vendoring packs from git repositories
- Git-only support (no local directory paths) with clear validation
- User-specified vendor location (e.g., vendor/org-standards)
- Submodule and subtree detection with workflow guidance (detect and inform only)
- Allow list warning in team mode (non-blocking) with clear suggestion to approve
- Error on duplicate vendoring with explicit removal instructions

**Lockfile provenance tracking:**

- vendor_path and vendor_type fields added to LockfileEntry
- AlignPack schema extended with vendor_path and vendor_type fields

**Documentation:**

- Added link command section to commands.md (~103 lines)
- Added vendoring workflows section to git-workflows.md (~164 lines)
- Submodule vs subtree tradeoffs documented
- Manual git operations documented (no automatic conversion)

**Test coverage:**

- 22 new tests: help/validation (3), basic operations (4), error cases (3), team mode (2), submodule detection (3), subtree detection (3), manual operations (2), edge cases (3)
- Total: 1424 → 1446 tests passing (100% pass rate)

**Known limitations:**

- No automatic submodule/subtree conversion (manual git operations required as documented)
- Lockfile update TODO in link.ts for actual provenance writing (to be completed when lockfile generation is finalized)

---

### Phase 3, Session 4: Pull Command Complete (Completed 2025-10-29)

**Pull command core:**

- `aligntrue pull` command operational for ad-hoc git-based rule pulling
- Try-before-commit workflow: pulls to temp by default (doesn't modify config)
- `--save` flag adds git source to config permanently
- `--ref <branch|tag|commit>` flag supports branch/tag/commit (defaults to main)
- `--sync` flag runs sync immediately after pull
- `--dry-run` flag shows what would be pulled without pulling
- `--offline` flag uses cache only (no network)

**Privacy consent integration:**

- Interactive prompts on first git operation use
- Persistent consent stored in `.aligntrue/privacy-consent.json`
- Respects offline mode (skips network, uses cache)
- Privacy consent passed to GitProvider at operation time

**Flag validation:**

- `--sync` requires `--save` (can't sync without adding to config)
- `--dry-run` excludes `--save` and `--sync` (preview only)
- Ref format validated (branch, tag, commit patterns)

**Documentation:**

- Created git-workflows.md guide (~360 lines): ad-hoc discovery, team sharing, CI/CD patterns, troubleshooting
- Updated commands.md with full pull command section (~135 lines): examples, workflows, privacy details
- Cross-references: git-workflows.md (ad-hoc) ↔ git-sources.md (config-based permanent sources)

**Test coverage:**

- 37 new tests: help/validation (7), basic pull (5), flags (5), privacy consent (6), error handling (7), integration (4), edge cases (3)
- Total: 1387 → 1424 tests passing (100% pass rate)

**Known limitations:**

- None blocking Session 5

---

### Phase 3, Session 3: Team Mode Polish (Completed 2025-10-29)

**Team UX enhancements:**

- Enhanced `aligntrue team enable` output with 📋 next steps, 👥 collaboration section, 💡 allow list tip
- `aligntrue team status` dashboard: shows lockfile mode, allow list count, drift placeholder, team members placeholder

**Team validation:**

- `packages/core/src/team/validation.ts` with 6 validation functions + error formatting
- Team validation rules: lockfile required (warning), lockfile mode not off, sources in allow list
- Team validation called from sync/check commands for stricter enforcement

**Lockfile validation enhancements:**

- validateAgainstAllowList: checks all sources in allow list
- checkDriftFromAllowedHashes: compares lockfile hashes to allow list
- validateLockfileTeamMode: team-specific lockfile validation

**Phase 3.5 lockfile prep:**

- Optional base_hash field added to LockfileEntry type
- Captured from source_sha when available (git sources)
- Zero logic, zero complexity - just field addition for future use
- Documented: "For Phase 3.5 overlay resolution"

**Test coverage:**

- 59 new tests: team UX (10), team validation (27), lockfile validation (17), base_hash (5)
- Total: 1328 → 1387 tests passing (100% pass rate)

**Known limitations:**

- Team members placeholder (no git detection logic implemented - deferred as not blocking)
- Drift detection foundation only (full implementation in Session 6)

---

### Phase 3, Session 2: Allow List Foundation (Completed 2025-10-29)

**Allow list schema and validation:**

- `.aligntrue/allow.yaml` file support with two formats:
  - `id@profile@version` (catalog, Phase 4 - placeholders only)
  - `sha256:...` raw hashes (git sources, working now)
- Team module: `packages/core/src/team/types.ts` (52 lines), `packages/core/src/team/allow.ts` (250 lines), `packages/core/src/team/index.ts` (7 lines)
- Resolution: Convert id@version to concrete hashes (git-only for now, catalog Phase 4)
- 38 tests (parsing, validation, resolution, edge cases)

**CLI commands operational:**

- `aligntrue team approve <source>` - Interactive, supports multiple sources, `--yes` for non-interactive
- `aligntrue team list-allowed` - Shows approved sources with status
- `aligntrue team remove <source>` - Removes from allow list with confirmation, `--yes` to skip
- 15 tests (approve, list, remove, interactive mode)

**Sync integration:**

- Sync command validates sources against allow list in team mode
- `--force` flag bypasses validation with warning
- Clear error messages with recovery suggestions (shows command to approve)
- Solo mode unaffected (no validation)
- 5 tests (validation, errors, force flag, team mode)

**Test coverage:**

- 58 new tests total: allow.test.ts (38), team.ts (15), sync.ts (5)
- Total: 1149 → 1328 tests passing (100% pass rate, +179 tests includes Phase 2.5 Plugs +86)

**Known limitations:**

- Catalog resolution deferred to Phase 4 (placeholder tests exist)

---

### Phase 3, Session 1: CLI Framework Migration (Completed 2025-10-29)

**CLI command framework migration complete:**

- All 7 CLI commands migrated to shared command framework
- Commands: adapters, team, telemetry, md, scopes, migrate, init
- Shared utilities: parseCommonArgs(), showStandardHelp()
- Consistent help text format across all commands
- Standard arg parsing with camelCase → kebab-case conversion

**Files modified:**

- 7 command files (~280 lines): adapters.ts (~50), team.ts (~40), telemetry.ts (new), md.ts (~40), scopes.ts (new), migrate.ts (~30), init.ts (~60)
- 2 test files (~5 lines): command-utilities.test.ts, command-test-helpers.test.ts
- COMMAND-FRAMEWORK.md (~170 lines added): comprehensive patterns documentation

**Test coverage:**

- 219/219 CLI tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Total: 1148/1149 tests (1 flaky performance test unrelated to migration)

**Key decisions:**

- Consistent arg parsing across all commands
- Standard help format: Usage, Description, Options, Examples
- Subcommand patterns standardized (team enable/disable/status, backup create/list/restore/cleanup)

**Known limitations:**

- md and migrate commands have no tests yet (planned for future sessions as needed)

---

### Phase 2.5: Plugs v1.1 (Completed 2025-10-30)

**Stack-agnostic rule authoring with configurable slots:**

- `[[plug:key]]` placeholders in rule content
- Defined in `plugs` section with name, description, default, required flag
- Validation at parse time: required plugs must have values
- TODO blocks for unresolved plugs: "TODO: Set [[plug:database-host]]"

**Dual hashing for fillable rules:**

- Pre-resolution hash: with `[[plug:key]]` placeholders intact
- Post-resolution hash: after filling plugs with actual values
- Lockfile tracks both hashes + unresolved plug count
- Enables drift detection: upstream changes vs local fill changes

**CLI commands:**

- `aln plugs audit` - Show all plugs (defined, filled, required unfilled)
- `aln plugs resolve` - Interactive wizard to fill required plugs
- `aln plugs set <key> <value>` - Set individual plug value

**Lockfile integration:**

- Source entries track: pre_resolution_hash, post_resolution_hash, unresolved_plugs_count
- Total unresolved count at lockfile level
- Enables "fillable rule" drift detection

**Exporter integration:**

- All 43 exporters updated to show "Unresolved Plugs: N" in footer
- TODO blocks emitted for unresolved required plugs
- Check findings created for unresolved plugs (rule id: plugs/unresolved-required)
- SARIF output includes plugs findings

**Test coverage:**

- Core: +56 tests (plugs types, schema, resolution, lockfile)
- CLI: +30 tests (plugs commands, audit, resolve, set)
- Total: +86 tests (1520 → 1606 tests passing, 100% pass rate)

**Known limitations:**

- PR comments (Phase 3) will display unresolved plug summary
- Advanced plug types (enum, regex) deferred until user request

## Pre-1.0 Policy

**Breaking changes allowed until 1.0 stable release.**

We reserve the right to iterate rapidly on:

- IR schema (spec_version field tracks changes)
- Config format
- Lockfile format
- CLI commands and flags

Migration framework will be added when:

- 50+ active repositories using AlignTrue, OR
- 10+ organizations with multiple repos each, OR
- Breaking change significantly impacts users

Until then: Optimal design over backwards compatibility.

See [Pre-1.0 Policy](docs/pre-1.0-policy.md) for details.
