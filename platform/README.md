# Platform layer (future)

This directory holds platform packages we are incubating outside the active workspace.

- Not part of the pnpm workspace yet; builds and CI ignore it.
- Enable later by adding `platform/*` (or the specific package) to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Keep contents self contained and side-effect free until promoted into the workspace.
