# AlignTrue Documentation

AlignTrue compiles YAML Aligns into deterministic bundles and agent-ready exports. The CLI validates schemas, pins hashes, and writes stable outputs for CI.

## Features

- **IR-first architecture** - Single source of truth in `aligntrue.yaml`
- **43 exporters** - Support for 28 AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, etc.)
- **Two-way sync** - Bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
- **Team mode** - Lockfiles, drift detection, and approval flows
- **Overlays** - Fork-safe customization without losing upstream updates
- **Local-first** - Everything works offline, cloud is optional

## Quick Start

Get started in under 60 seconds:

```bash
